## Working üìù 

- It process every file in that folder and Make relevant sub-folders by checking files extensions.
- It groups like files means all .txt,.docx,.pdf etc will be moved to a sub-folder named `Documents`.
- And due to `recursion` used in the code these steps gets repeated for nested folders and the process don't stop until no nested folder left to sort.
- This project utilizes the `fs` module to interact with the file system and move files into relevant subfolders.
