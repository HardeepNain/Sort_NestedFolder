We all are humans and we are lazy to manage things. 
But this little project can manage your files and can save a lot of time for you.

## Feature ‚ú®
Organize files into relevant folders including files present in any nested folder if exists.

## Working üìù 

- It process every file in that folder and Make relevant sub-folders by checking files extensions.
- It groups like files means all .txt,.docx,.pdf etc will be moved to a sub-folder named `Documents`.
- And due to `recursion` used in the code these steps gets repeated for nested folders and the process don't stop until no nested folder left to sort.
- This project utilizes the `fs` module to interact with the file system and move files into relevant subfolders.

Script : 
‚Ä¢	We all are humans and we are lazy to manage things. But this little project can manage your files and can save a lot of time for you.
‚Ä¢	Here we have a messy folder named Test which is pretty unorganized. 
‚Ä¢	As you can see, here we have multiple files with different types.
‚Ä¢	But we want these files should be in different subfolders based on their types.
‚Ä¢	So let‚Äôs sort out this Test folder.
‚Ä¢	How to use ?
‚Ä¢	First of all download this project‚Äôs executable file according to the Operating System you are using.
‚Ä¢	The link is given below in the description.
‚Ä¢	Then copy that exe file and paste beside the target folder you wanna sort.
‚Ä¢	Then goto file path and write cmd.
‚Ä¢	A command prompt will pop up. 
‚Ä¢	Write exe file name Sort in this case and target folder name Test in this case and press enter.
‚Ä¢	And our Test folder gets completely sorted.
‚Ä¢	All the images are moved in the Images foder and videos in the videos folder and so on.
‚Ä¢	And the files which are not suited to the predefined folders moved to the OtherMix folder.
‚Ä¢	But how ?
‚Ä¢	Working
‚Ä¢	It process every file in target folder and Make relevant sub-folders by checking files extensions.
‚Ä¢	It groups similar type of files in a particular folder means all .txt,.docx,.pdf etc will be moved to a sub-folder named "Documents".
‚Ä¢	And due to recursion used in the code this gets repeated for nested folders until no nested folder left to sort.
‚Ä¢	Hope you like this project.
